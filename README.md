My self-study journey in Quantum Computing, Quantum Mechanics, and Linear Algebra

# 🚀 Quantum Learning from Rural India — By Satya Pal 🇮🇳

Welcome to my open learning lab! I'm **Satya Pal**, a self-taught quantum computing learner, farmer, and former IT professional from **Badaun, Uttar Pradesh**, India.

After 13 years in the IT industry, I chose a different life — farming in my ancestral village, long-distance cycling (PBP qualifier), and now, **teaching and learning quantum mechanics and computing from scratch**.

This repository documents my self-study journey through:
- Quantum Mechanics (via Richard Feynman's *QED*)
- Linear Algebra (from Gilbert Strang’s book & MIT OCW)
- IBM Quantum Courses
- Hands-on projects using Qiskit
- My blackboard YouTube lectures 📺

## 🎥 My YouTube Channel: [QuantumSatya](https://www.youtube.com/@quantumsatya)

Join me as I explain complex quantum concepts in **Hindi & Hinglish** using chalk and blackboard from a village classroom. I connect physics to nature, farming, and rural metaphors to make it relatable.

✨ My Mission
I believe quantum education should not be limited to labs and metros. With a piece of chalk, a blackboard, and a cow in the background 🐄, I aim to bring quantum knowledge to rural learners.
